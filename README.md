# vasestl

An application for converting a 3D mathematical equation into an STL surface. Great for generating geometric shapes to print as vases, vessels or pots!

## Usage

1. In `main.rs`, update the `r` function to define the shape you wish to model. The function is in polar co-ordinates: it receives an angle (radians; between 0 and 2Ï€) and a z-height (between 0 and 1) and outputs a radius. For example, to define a cylinder of radius 20:

   ```rust
   fn r(t: f32, z: f32) -> f32 {
       20
   }
   ```

1. Near the top of `main.rs`, update the constants to define your parameters:

   - Rotational resolution
   - Height resolution
   - Total height
   - File output location

1. Run it

   ```shell
   cargo run --release
   ```
